# dotfiles

This repository centralizes configurations to be shared across multiple devices.

## Usage

Execute the following command
```bash 
bash setup.sh
```
This will generate and distribute the dotfiles to the appropriate locations. If an error occurs complaining about a missing environment variables, it means some required variable is not properly filled at ```$HOME/.dotfiles/variables```.
